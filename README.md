# brewbook-react
This is the second repo in my __Brew Book__ experiment I've been working on. The plan is to implement a craft beer cataloging app in the different popular front-end javascript frameworks (React, Angular, Ember, ect.) - [Tom McGurl](@https://twitter.com/tom_mcgurl)

This is my version of the popular [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), which is the inspiration for this project. I wanted to create a [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) app with some asynchronus data requests that would be close to something you would implement in a real world application.

This verision of the app is implemented with:

- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/): "A javascrip library for building user interfaces" - ReactJS Homepage
